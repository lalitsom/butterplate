# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

Before you start, read the **README.md** file for info on the project and how to set it up.

## Getting started

### Check out the roadmap

We have some functionalities in mind and we have issued them and there is a *milestone* label available on the issue. If there is a bug or a feature that is not listed in the **issues** page or there is no one assigned to the issue, feel free to fix/add it! Although it's better to discuss it in the issue or create a new issue for it so there is no conflicting code.

### Filing issues

Before starting work on a larger idea not discussed in an issue we recommend starting one to iron out your approach to implementation. PRs with conflicting ideas regarding architecture or other aspects of the project may be rejected. We appreciate any and all ideas you contribute providing they're discussed in a respectful and constructive manner.

Issues created that are not relevant to this project will be closed immediately - this is purely for efficiency as we don't have time to address and or move all of them to their correct place.

### Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

- Fork this repo.

And that's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like! You're change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests.

If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **master**. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

When you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.

### Tests

We've written tests and you can run them to assure the stability of the code, just try running `npm test`. If you're adding a new functionality please include tests for it.

### Documentation

Every chunk of code that may be hard to understand has some comments above it. If you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, it needs to be documented.


## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/buttercup).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
